## Description:
The assingment will be a series of audio visual experiences. There is 3 experiences available: "Pong Effect", "Retrowave" and "The Club".

## Pong Effect

### Description
Pong Effect is essentially a mix of *Tetris Effect* and *Super Hexagon*. The player travels through an infinite procedural world while trying to keep a ball from going off the 
screen. The idea is to allow the user to lose themselves in the music and take a break from the real world.




## Retrowave

### Description
Retrowave is a simple audio visualiser that leans heavily on the synth wave style of the 1980s.


## The Club

### Description
The Club is another audio visualiser that allows the user to *feel* the music.
